<p>
Uncover new insights in early childhood education and how media can support learning outcomes. Participate in our fifth annual Data Science Bowl, presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle.

PBS KIDS, a trusted name in early childhood education for decades, aims to gain insights into how media can help children learn important skills for success in school and life. In this challenge, youâ€™ll use anonymous gameplay data, including knowledge of videos watched and games played, from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready To Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. Your solutions will aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">Problem Statement</h2>
<p style="color:gray;font-size:15px">
In this competition, you are provided with game analytics for the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. In this app, children navigate a map and complete various levels, which may be activities, video clips, games, or assessments. Each assessment is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills. There are five assessments: Bird Measurer, Cart Balancer, Cauldron Filler, Chest Sorter, and Mushroom Sorter.</br>

 The intent of the competition is to use the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer is counted as an attempt). Each application install is represented by an `installation_id`. This will typically correspond to one child, but you should expect noise from issues such as shared devices. In the training set, you are provided the full history of gameplay data. In the test set, we have truncated the history after the start event of a single assessment, chosen randomly, for which you must predict the number of attempts. Note that the training set contains many `installation_id`s which never took assessments, whereas every `installation_id` in the test set made an attempt on at least one assessment.</br>
 
- 3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt
- 2: the assessment was solved on the second attempt
- 1: the assessment was solved after 3 or more attempts
- 0: the assessment was never solved

The file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. Assessment attempts are captured in `event_code` 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses `event_code` 4110. If the attempt was correct, it contains `"correct":true`.

<h2 style="color:blue">Data</h2>

<h3>train.csv & test.csv</h3>

These are the main data files which contain the gameplay events.

- `event_id` - Randomly generated unique identifier for the event type. Maps to event_id column in specs table.
- `game_session` - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping events within a single game or video play session.
- `timestamp` - Client-generated datetime
- `event_data` - Semi-structured JSON formatted string containing the events parameters. Default fields are: `event_count`, `event_code`, and `game_time`; otherwise fields are determined by the event type.
- `installation_id` - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping game sessions within a single installed application instance.
- `event_count` - Incremental counter of events within a game session (offset at 1). Extracted from `event_data`.
- `event_code` - Identifier of the event 'class'. Unique per game, but may be duplicated across games. E.g. event code '2000' always identifies the 'Start Game' event for all games. Extracted from `event_data`.
- `game_time` - Time in milliseconds since the start of the game session. Extracted from `event_data`.
- `title` - Title of the game or video.
- `type` - Media type of the game or video. Possible values are: 'Game', 'Assessment', 'Activity', 'Clip'.
- `world` - The section of the application the game or video belongs to. Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media. Possible values are: 'NONE' (at the app's start screen), TREETOPCITY' (Length/Height), 'MAGMAPEAK' (Capacity/Displacement), 'CRYSTALCAVES' (Weight).

<h3>specs.csv</h3>

This file gives the specification of the various event types.

- `event_id` - Global unique identifier for the event type. Joins to event_id column in events table.
- `info` - Description of the event.
- `args` - JSON formatted string of event arguments. Each argument contains:
- `name` - Argument name.
- `type` - Type of the argument (`string`, `int`, `number`, `object`, `array`).
- `info` - Description of the argument.

<h3>train_labels.csv</h3>

This file demonstrates how to compute the ground truth for the assessments in the training set.
